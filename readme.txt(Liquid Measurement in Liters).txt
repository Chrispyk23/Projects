How to run a Program
You would need a C++ related program or IDE and form there you would copy the code onto the program/IDE and run it.

Statements Used and their purpose for this program.
Int = the storage used for the amount of cans in a six-pack which of course is six.

const = Used to make the can volume and bottle volume constant.

double = used to handle the decimal numeric values in the program.

cout = The statement returned to the user concerning the contents of the cans and liters.

Return = Allows the program to display the results.

Expected Results of the program
A six-pack of 12-ounce cans contains2.13liters.
