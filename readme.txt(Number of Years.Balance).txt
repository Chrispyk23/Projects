Number of years/ Balance program

Project Summary
This program allows you to determine a number of years based on the number of years entered. Using a constant rate to achieve the results. And return a balance based on the Rate + 1 divided by 100. 
How To Run The Program
You would need a C++ related program or IDE and form there you would copy the code onto the program/IDE and run it


Statements Used and their purpose in this program
Const = Used to keep a constant rate and balance for the program
Double = Used to store a large number for the balance which will be spread out and increasing across the number of years.
Cout = Used to prompt the user to enter the number of years they desire 
Cin = Used to accept the number of years from the user of the program.
Int = Used as the storage for the number of years since itâ€™s only going to be common used numbers (i.e 1-100) in the program.
For Loop =  The execution portion of the program used to create the results wanted from the program. It adds 1 to the year as the program continues on and equals the balance by 1 + 5 /100 * 10000
Return = Returns and displays the previously mentioned results.

Expected Results 
The program should return a balance starting with 10500 and increasing further and further based on the number of years inputted into the program.
